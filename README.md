## What is Atomics?
Atomics is a static periodic table website, that sources info out of a JSON file.
Small project based off things I'm currently learning in school.
This was made for my portfolio https://raidlucky.github.io/Projects/

## Tools used
This small project was made in vanilla js, css, and html.
JSON file is from https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON, however I did make some changes to it myself
